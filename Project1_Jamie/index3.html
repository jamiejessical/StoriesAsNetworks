                <p>The term "comma" comes from the Greek word "koptein," which means "to cut off." The name reflects the punctuation mark's historical use in separating distinct parts of a sentence or list. In ancient Greek texts, a small mark resembling a modern comma was employed to indicate where a reader should pause for a short breath or where a phrase should be "cut off" from the rest of the sentence. <br><br>The comma's function as a separator and indicator of pauses or breaks in a sentence has persisted through the evolution of written language, and the name "comma" has been adopted in various languages, including English. The symbol has played a crucial role in clarifying the structure and meaning of sentences, helping readers and writers convey their ideas more effectively.</p>
