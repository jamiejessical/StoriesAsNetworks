                <p>The question mark's current form has evolved over centuries and is believed to have originated from the Latin word "quaestio," which means "question." The modern question mark (?) has its roots in the Latin word "quaestio," and it developed through various script forms over time.</p>

                <p>One theory suggests that the question mark evolved from the Latin word "quaestio" written as "qo." Over time, the "q" and "o" were written more closely together, and the "o" evolved into a small dot or circle placed above the line. This eventually transformed into the recognizable shape of the question mark we use today.</p>
